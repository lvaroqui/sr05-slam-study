# SR05 SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) Study
SLAM proof of concept using Webots simulator for the SR05 course.

The goal of this proof of concept is to show that we can use the Webots Simulator to test SLAM algorithm.

We developed a monitoring app that can connect via TCP to a virtual robot and see its map being updated in real time. 
The WeBots controllers are implemented in C++ as well as the monitoring app.

Here is a video showing an exploration by two robots: [Youtube Video](https://youtu.be/t-34pDXOM4c)
